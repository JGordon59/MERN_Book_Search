  ## Description:
  - I built this project to have an easy and convenient way to search any book, get information about it, and store it for later.
  - This project allows me to avoid using multiple different services to, without purchasing anything, accomplish the above task.
  - I learned during this project that refactoring older RESTful APIs into GraphQL APIs is a painful process, and to be thorough about it.
  - This project stands out for its use of very new technologies.
